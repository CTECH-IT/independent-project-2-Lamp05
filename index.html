          <p class="NC-Content" id="EP-Desc">The "Exploration Hall" is a large room within the Nature center where you can learn about
            animals and fossils. It's a very hands-on experience, with many of the fossils and other pieces of nature
            laid out on tables, intended to be handled and examined.</p>

            can watch and read about. Some of the turtles even have names, which I find especially adorable.</p>

          Quarry Hill is a nonprofit organization in Rochester Minnesota. They are a nature center that educates people through hands-on, fun experiences. They also have a large trail system, with lots of outdoor activities throughout the year. On top of all this, they also take record of local wildlife and vegetation that they send to the University of Minnesota. Personally, getting to visit Quarry Hill during field trips was always a fun and enriching experience. Rochester just wouldn't be the same without Quarry Hill.
